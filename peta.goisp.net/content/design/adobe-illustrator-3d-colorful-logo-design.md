Welcome to Adobe illustrator course cc 2020. And in this video I will be teaching you how you can create colorful logo. Now it's super easy to do and let's see how that's done.

The first thing we have to do is to create on your document. So the document that I wouldn't be using for district auditor is this custom sized document which is called in by a thousand pixels. And I repeat be naming this store reading column for logo. So in case if you want to use the same size document as I am you can easily just add the values in the rich and the height options right here. Or if you feel like you can use some outdoor size documents which are already being provided by Adobe Illustrator and you just click on tiered. OK.

So the first thing we want to do is to create this shape of us. Let us see what we're going to do is I will be using this ellipse do it right here. See if we just click on this binary for a few seconds you wouldn't get this ellipse to detail. And I do not require the FIT AS OF. I let this drill be black the way it does so I'm going to do is click click on shift plus or. And then just jog my most to create one big so good like that. Now we're going to go back to the Ellipse do it again and repeat the same process by clicking onto shiftless or. And this time I will be creating a small silken like this. OK. So I wouldn't be reading too much so good. Oh he'll run about months of good will come over here. And the others is going to come on the bottom but tried to come back here to this ellipse story flick on shiftless orange and just Jack was too meek. So like that it's OK if it's some portions of yourself is sticking out that's fine. But Jane make sure that it fits more or less into the guide like that. I'm just going to leave a little bit out side so that when we make this shape it becomes easier. Zooming on to some spots. Jose you do sing. This is. OK. So I'll be selecting the so we just created and I want to make another one right. All right. So I will be just clicking on on and just jacking it at the bottom like that. So once that's done you can go ahead and select all of them come over here to this ship builder do. The shortcut key for this will is shift plus M. So if I move my closet around as you can see that the shape build up the way it differentiates all these shaded bars in two different pots. Right. So what I want to do is be just combining all of them together like this and I do not require this ocean so to delete this all I'm going to do is click on it and click on delete debate and then go ahead and delete it delete the portions actually do not require by clicking on or like that and be selecting on of them again and this time I just let the stroke weight be too high up to two points that and if there are any other lines you feel that it's dead you can get rid of them as well as after a check like this. OK. So in case you do see any points or ankle points that that there is one those smoothing the edges out you click on that and go point and you just drag it like this still it becomes into a smooth part and could just give you the portions you do need. This select design uncoupling and also this more than this one not like that. OK. So it looks much better this is the I see another angle going right here. Which means do we just go like that. So next thing we're not going to do is to do different gradients in these spots. So I would be now using the do and making sure that there is no fail again we just acquire those stroke. So by using the thing do we meet one and go point here and make another anchor plane like this and then just jack the mouse upwards or downwards like this by holding on to the anchor points to make an order like that and clicking on escape to get rid of the pen do it like this. Soon not going to make do with more ankle do more. OK something like this on the media portion and one on the lower portion DiDio so just make another anchor point to anchor point over here and just jagged mouse to me and I like that you're going to skip to get rid of the bank to make another point. Oh yo we go couple take this and Joyce word around like that and press escape to get rid of the bank it. OK. So now what are we going to do again is go ahead and select all of them. And with the help of the shape builder tool as you can see that it now recognizes all these spots are different but right. So for now I would be just filling it with solid colors. Then we can just go ahead and add the gradient. Luckily though so. And that I'd select all these extra spots I'll delay this and get rid of them as well. Let's select all of them and also a good bit of the stroke as well. OK. So as you can see thanks to the shape in to all these different pots I'm broke. I'm going just select them manually and add the gradients as well we like so let's elect this one. This first portion. Click on this gradient to right here. And as you can see in this gradient slide or this is by default that the gradient is from white to black. We can go ahead and author James Duncan Lewis click on this white one and choose a random color. So let's say you light blue and the black one and it was dark blue and just change the angle. Like this. I'll probably just make it go with the light that maybe just go ahead and similarly add different guy knows still details of the dots like that. So it's like this line go back to the gradient do it this time just change the color of the light blue so more knowing colors that actually so well with dark blue. Yeah. So Yellow looks really good color. This just change the anger like that select card line come back to the gradient do it and instead of dark blue now I be using the lower red. This change the anger. I that come back here to this last portion. Come over here to this gradient do it. And instead of yellow now click on double click on this and I'll be using the color. Pink it would look good. Yeah. Like that. Oh now we've added the different gradients. So let's go ahead and also add another background following something like this. So I'll be coming back here to District anger do. And for now I'll be just using a somewhat light green fellow I just go over your door. This one Cornell and then just drag my mouse so that it becomes God was up the entire document like that right click on my square that I just created to arrange and send you back so I click on this and select the background and come back here to the region double again and this time what are you doing. Oh yeah I'll be adding a light green glow and instead of the red eye be adding a darker shade of green. And in this type one I'll be using the radial gradient like that and then I read go gradients Now you note I can just leave it on that. This looks pretty good. I'll just move this around if that's needed. But yeah the last thing I want to do is select all my portions these spots again and I'll add a drop shadow behind it. So in order to do that would be going to effect stylized and job shadow. So if you click on preview you can see that a drop shadow has been added and the opacity is the same. I have an itch and we're going to jeans your passage I'm going to let it be  percent yet the setting be the way you're jizz and then you go to these colorful logo has now been created with different effects as well. So now we can go ahead and also save our document in order to do that. What you going to fire looking on save us and by default. I finally was going to be the same as our document which was global logo and my senior vice guy is going to be an Adobe Illustrator site. I highly recommend I receive a file in this format so that it is if I want to make any calendar changes I can easily do that by accessing my site and just clicking on. See. OK. And that's it. A document has not been successfully conceived as an Adobe Illustrator. I hope you found this tutorial to be useful and within it a practice you can also play around with different Legos and I different visions and if you want or just let the colors be a solid color as well. Thank you for watching and stay tuned for more with.
